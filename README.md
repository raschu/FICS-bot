# FICS-bot
With this Perl script you are able to let play UCI chess engines on the FICS (freechess.org) server.

If you want let play an UCI chess engine on a ICS Server, then my Perl script could be for you. All you need are these files, an UCI engine and timeseal (for other Server than FICS you could alternatively use IO::Socket or timestamp on ICC).
